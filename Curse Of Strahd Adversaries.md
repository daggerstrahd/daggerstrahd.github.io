Commander +3, Intimidation +3, Magical Knowledge +3, Nobility +3, Stealth +2

### FEATURES

**Shapechanger - Passive**  
Strahd can use an action to transform into a Tiny bat (fly speed), Medium wolf, or cloud of mist. His statistics remain the same except for movement. He reverts to his true form if reduced to 0 HP. In mist form, he can pass through tiny spaces and is immune to physical damage but vulnerable to sunlight.

**Legendary Resistance - Passive**  
Three times per session, when Strahd would mark Stress or HP from an attack or harmful effect, he can choose to ignore it entirely.

**Regeneration - Passive**  
At the start of each of Strahd's turns, he clears 2 Hit Points, provided he has at least 1 HP remaining and isn't in sunlight or running water.

Strahd can climb any surface, including upside down on ceilings, without needing to make any rolls.

**Vampire Weaknesses - Passive**  
- Cannot enter residences without invitation
- Takes 3 Stress per round while in sunlight
- Takes 2 Stress if ending turn in running water

- Destroyed permanently if staked through the heart while at 0 HP in his coffin

**Misty Escape - Reaction**  
When reduced to 0 HP outside his coffin (and not in sunlight/running water), Strahd transforms into mist form instead of being defeated. He must reach his coffin within 2 hours.

**Charm - Action (3 Stress)**  
Strahd targets one humanoid within Close range. They must make a Presence + Instinct roll (Difficulty 19). On a failure, they become charmed and view Strahd as a trusted friend for 24 hours or until Strahd or his allies harm them. Charmed targets will allow Strahd to bite them.

**Children of the Night - Action (4 Stress, once per session)**  
Strahd summons 2d4 swarms of bats or rats (or 3d6 wolves if outdoors). They arrive in 1d4 rounds and obey his commands for 1 hour.

**Bite - Action (2 Stress)**  
Against a willing, charmed, restrained, or unconscious target within Melee range. Make an attack roll. On success, deal 3d8+6 magic damage and Strahd clears that much HP. Target's max HP is reduced by the damage dealt until they complete a long rest.

**Move Like Shadow - Action (2 Stress)**  
Strahd can teleport to any unoccupied space within Far range that he can see, provided both his starting position and destination are in dim light or darkness.

**Unarmed Strike - Action**

**Dominate - Action (3 Stress)**  
Strahd attempts to seize control of a creature's mind. Target one creature within Close range. They must make a Presence + Instinct roll (Difficulty 19). On a failure, Strahd can issue a single command that isn't directly harmful to the target, and they must obey it on their next turn.

### LAIR ACTIONS
While in Castle Ravenloft, Strahd can spend 2 Fear at the start of each round to take one of these lair actions:

- **Phase Through Walls:** Until the start of the next round, Strahd can move through solid walls, floors, and ceilings as if they weren't there
- **Seal the Castle:** Strahd targets any number of doors and windows in the castle, causing them to slam shut and magically lock (Difficulty 18 to force open)
- **Summon Specter:** An angry spirit appears next to one enemy Strahd can see, makes one attack (use Standard adversary of appropriate tier), then vanishes
- **Living Shadow:** Target one creature within Close range of Strahd whose shadow is visible. The shadow detaches and becomes a hostile shadow creature under Strahd's control

### ROLEPLAYING STRAHD

**Personality:** Cold, calculating, supremely confident. Strahd sees himself as above mortal concerns. He can be charming and philosophical when it suits him, but his cruelty is casual and absolute. He views the PCs as either amusing distractions or potential successors/consorts.

**In Combat:** Strahd never fights fairly. He attacks from advantage, uses the environment, and retreats without shame when outmatched. He prefers to toy with opponents, testing their capabilities. He focuses attacks on charismatic or arrogant PCs who remind him of himself.

**Quotes:**
- "I am The Ancient. I am The Land."
- "You think you can destroy me? I have faced armies. You are but gnats."
- "She looks so much like Tatyana... Perhaps you will deliver her to me willingly?"
- "Your courage is... amusing. But ultimately futile."

## CONVERSION NOTES

### Difficulty Guidelines
- D&D CR 0-2 → Tier 1 (Difficulty 11-13)
- D&D CR 3-5 → Tier 1-2 (Difficulty 13-15)
- D&D CR 6-10 → Tier 2-3 (Difficulty 15-17)
- D&D CR 11-15 → Tier 3-4 (Difficulty 17-19)
- D&D CR 16+ → Tier 4 (Difficulty 19-20+)

### HP and Thresholds
- D&D HP divided by 10-15 roughly converts to Daggerheart HP
- Thresholds should be set so Major = ~1/3 max HP, Severe = ~2/3 max HP
- Stress typically equals HP for most creatures

### Damage Conversion
- D&D average damage ÷ 2 gives approximate Daggerheart damage
- Add attack modifier to damage for simplicity
- Use damage dice that feel appropriate:
  - d6s for weak attacks
  - d8s for standard attacks
  - d10s for strong attacks
  - d12s for legendary attacks

### Special Abilities
- **Legendary Actions** -> Multiple actions per round or powerful once-per-rest abilities
- **Lair Actions** -> Spend Fear to activate environmental effects
- **Legendary Resistance** -> Limited uses of "ignore this effect"
- **D&D Saving Throws** -> Daggerheart rolls (Agility, Presence, Instinct, etc.)

### Attack Modifier Guidelines
- **Tier 1:** +1 to +2
- **Tier 2:** +2 to +3
- **Tier 3:** +3 to +4
- **Tier 4:** +4 to +5

### Using Fear Economy
The GM should use Fear tokens strategically:
- **1 Fear:** Activate minor abilities, summon reinforcements
- **2 Fear:** Use powerful abilities, trigger lair actions
- **3+ Fear:** Activate devastating abilities, call in major reinforcements

### Running Horror in Daggerheart
- Use **Stress** to represent psychological horror - mark Stress for frightening encounters
- **Hope** represents the light against darkness - reward players for acts of courage
- **Fear** represents the GM's ability to make things worse - build tension
- Characters should feel vulnerable but capable

### Barovia-Specific Mechanics
- **Sunlight:** True sunlight (like the Sunsword) bypasses vampire resistances completely
- **Silvered Weapons:** Bypass lycanthrope damage resistance
- **Running Water:** Vampires take Stress each round
- **Invitations:** Vampires cannot enter homes without invitation
- **Stakes:** A vampire staked through the heart at 0 HP in its coffin is permanently destroyed
