                <p>The mists have taken you. You find yourselves in <strong>Barovia</strong>, a land trapped in eternal twilight, ruled by the immortal vampire <strong>Count Strahd von Zarovich</strong>.</p>
                
                <p style="margin-top: 1rem;">This is a land without hope. The sun never fully rises. The mists turn travelers around, no matter how far they walk. The people are broken, their spirits crushed under centuries of Strahd's rule.</p>
                
                <p style="margin-top: 1rem;">A fortune-teller named <strong>Madam Eva</strong> reveals your destiny through her tarokka cards, you are meant to face the ancient evil that haunts this land. Three artifacts of power await discovery. An ally will aid you. And a final confrontation with the vampire lord himself looms.</p>
                
                <p style="margin-top: 1rem;"><strong>But be warned:</strong> Strahd is not a villain to be easily defeated. He is a master tactician, a powerful wizard, and has had centuries to perfect his cruelty. He will test you, torment you, and try to break your spirit before he kills you.</p>
                
                <p style="margin-top: 1rem; font-style: italic; color: #fca5a5;">Can you bring light to this land of darkness? Can you break the curse and free Barovia? Or will you become just another ghost wandering the Old Svalich Road, another failed challenger in Strahd's endless game?</p>

                <h2>Campaign Overview</h2>
                
                <h3>The Land of Barovia</h3>
                <p>Barovia exists in a demiplane, torn from its original world by the mysterious <strong>Dark Powers</strong>. Deadly mists surround the land, no matter how far you walk, you end up back where you started. The sun never fully breaks through the perpetual cloud cover, casting everything in gray gloom.</p>
                
                <p style="margin-top: 0.75rem;">This land is trapped in time, isolated from the outside world. The same souls are reborn generation after generation. The people are broken, terrified, and have long since abandoned hope. They cower in their villages, fearing the night and the wolves that howl from the Svalich Woods.</p>
                
                <h3>Strahd von Zarovich - The Ancient</h3>
                <p><strong>In life</strong>, Strahd von Zarovich was a count, a prince, a soldier, and a conqueror. After the death of his father, King Barov, Strahd waged long bloody wars against his family's enemies. He cornered the last of them in a remote mountain valley and slaughtered them all. He named the valley Barovia after his father.</p>
                
                <p style="margin-top: 0.75rem;">But peace made Strahd restless. He felt his best years slipping away. Unwilling to age like his father, he studied magic and forged a pact with the Dark Powers in return for immortality.</p>
                
                <p style="margin-top: 0.75rem;"><strong>Then came Tatyana.</strong> A young Barovian woman of remarkable beauty. Strahd lavished her with attention, believing her worthy to be his bride. But she fell in love with his younger brother, Sergei instead.</p>
                
                <p style="margin-top: 0.75rem;">On the day of Sergei and Tatyana's wedding, Strahd gazed into a mirror and realized he had been a fool. He murdered Sergei, drank his blood, and sealed his pact with darkness. When he chased Tatyana through the castle gardens, she threw herself from the walls rather than submit to him.</p>
                
                <p style="margin-top: 0.75rem;"><strong>Strahd became a vampire.</strong> The sky went black. The castle guards shot him with arrows, but he did not die. He slaughtered them all. The castle and valley were spirited away, locked in a demiplane surrounded by deadly mists. For Strahd and his people, there would be no escape.</p>
                
                <p style="margin-top: 0.75rem; font-style: italic; color: #fca5a5;">For centuries now, Strahd has ruled Barovia. He takes consorts, feeds on the people, and plays games with strangers who wander into his domain. Every generation, Tatyana's soul is reborn. The current incarnation is <strong>Ireena Kolyana</strong>, and Strahd will stop at nothing to claim her.</p>
                
                <h3>Strahd's Goals</h3>
                <div class="grid grid-2">
                    <div class="card">
                        <h4>Claim Ireena</h4>
                        <p style="font-size: 0.875rem;">Strahd has already bitten Ireena twice. He intends to turn her into his vampire spawn consort, believing her to be Tatyana reborn.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="card">
                        <h4>Find Van Richten</h4>
                        <p style="font-size: 0.875rem;">The legendary vampire hunter has come to Barovia in disguise. Strahd wants to find him, lock him in his dungeons, and slowly break his spirit.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="card">
                        <h4>Test the Newcomers</h4>
                        <p style="font-size: 0.875rem;">Strahd senses your arrival. He will test you, studying your tactics and weaknesses. Are you worthy challengers? Or just more prey?</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="card">
                        <h4>Find a Successor</h4>
                        <p style="font-size: 0.875rem;">Deep down, Strahd believes the key to escaping Barovia is finding someone worthy to rule in his place. But his arrogance ensures no one is ever good enough.</p>

                <h3>How to Defeat Strahd</h3>
                <p>Strahd cannot be permanently destroyed unless several conditions are met:</p>
                <ul style="font-size: 0.875rem; margin-top: 0.5rem;">
                    <li><strong>Find the Three Fated Treasures:</strong> The Sunsword, Holy Symbol of Ravenkind, and Tome of Strahd (locations determined by Tarokka reading)</li>
                    <li><strong>Destroy the Heart of Sorrow:</strong> A 10-foot crystal in Castle Ravenloft that absorbs all damage meant for Strahd</li>
                    <li><strong>Reduce Strahd to 0 HP:</strong> Force him into mist form and back to his coffin</li>
                    <li><strong>Stake him in his coffin:</strong> While at 0 HP in his coffin, drive a wooden stake through his heart</li>
                    <li><strong>Expose him to sunlight:</strong> Or keep him staked until sunrise to destroy him permanently</li>
                </ul>
                
                <p style="margin-top: 1rem; font-style: italic; color: #fca5a5;">But even if you destroy Strahd, will the mists release Barovia? Or will the Dark Powers simply choose a new master? Some questions have no easy answers.</p>

                <h3>The Mists of Barovia</h3>
                <div class="card-lg">
                    <p>Deadly fog surrounds Barovia. Any creature that tries to leave must make an <strong>Instinct Reaction Roll (20)</strong> every hour or gain 1 level of Stress. Even flying creatures cannot escape.</p>
                    <p>The mists turn travelers around, no matter how far you walk, you end up back in Barovia.</p>
                </div>
                
                <h3>Sunlight in Barovia</h3>
                <div class="card-lg">
                    <p>By the will of the Dark Powers, the sun never fully shines. Even during the day, thick clouds or mist obscure the light.</p>
                    <p><strong>Effect:</strong> Daylight in Barovia provides bright light but does NOT count as sunlight for vampire vulnerabilities. Strahd and his spawn can move about during the day. Only magical sunlight (from spells or items like the Sunsword) affects vampires normally.</p>
                </div>
                
                <h3>Fortunes of Ravenloft</h3>
                <div class="card-lg">
                    <p>When the party first meets Madam Eva, she performs a tarokka card reading that determines the location of three powerful artifacts and where Strahd can be confronted.</p>
                    <h4>The Fated Items:</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>The Tome of Strahd: A journal revealing Strahd's history</li>
                        <li>The Sunsword: A legendary blade that deals magic damage and creates true sunlight</li>
                        <li>The Holy Symbol of Ravenkind: Can hold vampires at bay and cause direct damage</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Whenever a PC discovers one of the fated items, they immediately gain <strong>3 Hope tokens</strong> and clear <strong>1d4 Stress</strong>.</p>
                </div>
                
                <h3>Hope in Despair</h3>
                <div class="card-lg">
                    <p>Barovia is a land where hope dies slowly. This mechanic represents the difficulty of maintaining morale.</p>
                    <p><strong>Rule:</strong> At the start of each session, each PC must make a <strong>Presence Reaction Roll (12)</strong>. On a failure, they start the session with 1 fewer Hope token (minimum 0).</p>
                    <p><strong>Exception:</strong> If the party made significant progress last session (rescued someone, found a treasure, defeated a major foe), this roll is not required.</p>

                        even though Daggerheart treats all magic damage uniformly. Feel free to ignore the damage types mechanically and simply apply them as magic damage, or embrace them for thematic
                        effects and player creativity (burn the witch!).</p>

                        These legendary artifacts can turn the tide against Strahd. Finding these fated items should either come with a Level Up of the party or be a significant milestone in the campaign.

Will not willingly be surrendered or used against good-aligned creatures. Demands to be wielded in combat against evil.</p>

                        <li><strong>Hold Undead (Action, Spends a Fear):</strong> Force all undead within Close range to make an Instinct Reaction Roll (17).

                    <p style="font-size: 0.875rem; margin-top: 0.75rem;"><strong>Obsession (Drawback):</strong> If Strahd learns you have his tome, he becomes fixated on recovering it.

                    <p style="margin: 0; font-size: 0.95rem;">Use narrative milestones, not XP. Advance when major Barovian objectives are achieved. Aim for party Level 5-6 before the final fight with Strahd so the battle feels deadly but winnable.

                        <p style="font-size: 0.875rem;">You were traveling elsewhere when fog surrounded you. When it cleared, you were on the Old Svalich Road leading to the Village of Barovia. You cannot leave the same way.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="card">
                        <h4>Native Barovian</h4>
                        <p style="font-size: 0.875rem;">You've lived under Strahd's shadow your entire life. You know the land, the customs, and the hopelessness. But you dare to fight.</p>

                    <div class="card">
                        <h4>Vistani Traveler</h4>
                        <p style="font-size: 0.875rem;">You travel with a Vistani caravan, one of the few groups who can pass through the mists. You've heard stories of Barovia and Strahd all your life.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="card">
                        <h4>Summoned by Fate</h4>
                        <p style="font-size: 0.875rem;">You received a mysterious letter from Kolyan Indirovich, burgomaster of Barovia, begging for help. The mists guided you here for a reason.</p>

                <h3>Ancestries in Barovia</h3>
                <p style="font-size: 0.875rem; color: #d1d5db; margin-bottom: 1rem;">All standard Daggerheart ancestries can exist in Barovia, but they take on the land's gothic flavor.</p>
                
                <div class="grid grid-2">
                    <div class="card">
                        <h4>Human</h4>
                        <p style="font-size: 0.875rem;">Native Barovians are pale, dark-haired, and haunted. They speak in hushed tones and avoid eye contact. Foreign humans look healthier but won't for long.</p>
                        <p style="font-size: 0.75rem; color: #fbbf24; margin-top: 0.5rem;"><strong>Fits:</strong> Any class. Most Barovians.</p>

                    <div class="card">
                        <h4>Elf</h4>
                        <p style="font-size: 0.875rem;">The dusk elves (dusky skin, dark hair) are nearly extinct; Strahd slaughtered most when they refused to turn over a woman he desired. Only a handful remain. Other elves are outsiders.</p>
                        <p style="font-size: 0.75rem; color: #fbbf24; margin-top: 0.5rem;"><strong>Fits:</strong> Rangers, rogues. Tragic backstory.</p>

                    <div class="card">
                        <h4>Dwarf</h4>
                        <p style="font-size: 0.875rem;">Hardy folk from mountain communities or trapped travelers. Their resistance to poison helps against cursed wine and tainted food common in Barovia.</p>
                        <p style="font-size: 0.75rem; color: #fbbf24; margin-top: 0.5rem;"><strong>Fits:</strong> Warriors, guardians. Stubborn hope.</p>
                    </div>
                    
                    <div class="card">
                        <h4>Halfling</h4>
                        <p style="font-size: 0.875rem;">Small folk trying to stay unnoticed. Their natural optimism is a light in the darkness, though Barovia tests it constantly.</p>
                        <p style="font-size: 0.75rem; color: #fbbf24; margin-top: 0.5rem;"><strong>Fits:</strong> Rogues, bards. Hope-bringers.</p>
                    </div>
                    
                    <div class="card">
                        <h4>Orc</h4>
                        <p style="font-size: 0.875rem;">Fierce warriors who refuse to bow to Strahd. Their strength is needed but often feared by superstitious Barovians.</p>
                        <p style="font-size: 0.75rem; color: #fbbf24; margin-top: 0.5rem;"><strong>Fits:</strong> Warriors, barbarians. Defiant spirit.</p>

                    <div class="card">
                        <h4>Fungril</h4>
                        <p style="font-size: 0.875rem;">Mushroom folk thrive in Barovia's damp, decaying places. Your connection to death and decay resonates with the land itself in unsettling ways.</p>
                        <p style="font-size: 0.75rem; color: #fbbf24; margin-top: 0.5rem;"><strong>Fits:</strong> Druids, rangers. Death-touched.</p>

                    <div class="card">
                        <h4>Faerie</h4>
                        <p style="font-size: 0.875rem;">Creatures of joy and mischief struggle in this land of sorrow. Your fey nature makes you anathema to undead, but the oppression weighs heavily on you.</p>
                        <p style="font-size: 0.75rem; color: #fbbf24; margin-top: 0.5rem;"><strong>Fits:</strong> Bards, rogues. Light vs darkness.</p>

                    <div class="card">
                        <h4>Ribbet</h4>
                        <p style="font-size: 0.875rem;">Frog-folk from Lake Zarovich or swamps. You might know secrets of the cursed waters or have witnessed the horror beneath the surface.</p>
                        <p style="font-size: 0.75rem; color: #fbbf24; margin-top: 0.5rem;"><strong>Fits:</strong> Druids, rogues. Swamp natives.</p>

                <h3>Communities in Barovia</h3>
                <p style="font-size: 0.875rem; color: #d1d5db; margin-bottom: 1rem;">Your community determines your relationship to civilization, magic, and each other.</p>

                    <div class="card">

                        <p style="font-size: 0.875rem;">Scholars, sages, priests. You seek knowledge to break the curse: ancient texts, forbidden lore, or religious wisdom. The libraries and temples of Barovia hold dark secrets.</p>
                        <p style="font-size: 0.75rem; color: #9ca3af; margin-top: 0.5rem;"><em>Examples:</strong> Priest of the Morninglord, Van Richten's student, wizard's apprentice, historian</em></p>

                        <p style="font-size: 0.875rem;">Knights, soldiers, paladins. You belong to (or seek to restore) the Order of the Silver Dragon or serve as town guard. You believe in law and duty even when hope fades.</p>
                        <p style="font-size: 0.75rem; color: #9ca3af; margin-top: 0.5rem;"><em>Examples:</strong> Revenant's descendant, Vallaki guard, knight errant, oath-keeper</em></p>

                        <p style="font-size: 0.875rem;">Thieves, smugglers, survivors. You know the secret ways, who to bribe, how to avoid Strahd's attention. You've learned to take what you need to survive in this cursed land.</p>
                        <p style="font-size: 0.75rem; color: #9ca3af; margin-top: 0.5rem;"><em>Examples:</strong> Vallaki smuggler, tomb robber, street urchin, spy</em></p>

                        <p style="font-size: 0.875rem;">Rangers, druids, hermits. You live in the Svalich Woods or mountains, away from civilization. You might be part of the Keepers of the Feather (wereravens) or survive alone.</p>
                        <p style="font-size: 0.75rem; color: #9ca3af; margin-top: 0.5rem;"><em>Examples:</strong> Wereraven ally, forest hermit, mountain guide, druid</em></p>

                        <p style="font-size: 0.875rem;">Mountaineers, miners, isolated villagers. You're from Krezk or other mountain communities. Hardy, suspicious of outsiders, but protective of your own.</p>
                        <p style="font-size: 0.75rem; color: #9ca3af; margin-top: 0.5rem;"><em>Examples:</strong> Krezk villager, mountain shepherd, stone mason, miner</em></p>

                        <p style="font-size: 0.875rem;">You come from beyond Barovia, a traveler from distant shores. The mists have trapped you far from home, and you seek a way back, or forward.</p>

                <p style="font-size: 0.875rem; color: #d1d5db; margin-bottom: 1rem;">Why does your character dare to oppose Strahd when all others have given up?</p>

                        <li><strong>Seek Revenge:</strong> Strahd killed someone you loved. You'll destroy him or die trying.</li>
                        <li><strong>Break the Curse:</strong> You believe you're meant to end this. Prophecy, duty, or stubborn hope drives you.</li>

                        <h4>Haunted One</h4>
                        <p style="font-size: 0.875rem;">You've witnessed something that shattered your understanding of reality. You came to Barovia seeking answers or running from your past. You're harder to frighten but haunted by visions.</p>

                        <p style="font-size: 0.875rem;">You've trained specifically to hunt undead. You know their weaknesses, carry holy water and wooden stakes, and understand what you're facing, which makes it worse.</p>

                <h3>Class Recommendations</h3>
                <p style="font-size: 0.875rem; color: #d1d5db; margin-bottom: 1rem;">All classes work in Barovia, but some themes resonate particularly well with the gothic horror setting.</p>
                
                <div class="grid grid-2">
                    <div class="card">
                        <h4>Guardian / Warrior</h4>
                        <p style="font-size: 0.875rem;">Protectors of the innocent, knights seeking to restore honor, or simple defenders standing against the darkness. Your courage matters more than your sword.</p>

                    <div class="card">
                        <h4>Ranger / Rogue</h4>
                        <p style="font-size: 0.875rem;">Survivors who know the land, trackers hunting monsters, or infiltrators seeking Strahd's weaknesses. Knowledge and cunning are weapons here.</p>

                    <div class="card">
                        <h4>Wizard / Sorcerer</h4>
                        <p style="font-size: 0.875rem;">Seekers of arcane knowledge, challengers to Strahd's magical dominance, or desperate souls willing to risk dark power at the Amber Temple.</p>
                    </div>
                    
                    <div class="card">
                        <h4>Cleric / Druid</h4>
                        <p style="font-size: 0.875rem;">Faithful servants of the Morninglord or nature itself, bringing light and healing to a land that desperately needs both. Your magic is hope incarnate.</p>
