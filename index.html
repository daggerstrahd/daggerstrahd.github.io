                <p>The mists have taken you. You find yourselves in <strong>Barovia</strong>, a land trapped in eternal twilight, ruled by the immortal vampire <strong>Count Strahd von Zarovich</strong>.</p>
                
                <p style="margin-top: 1rem;">This is a land without hope. The sun never fully rises. The mists turn travelers around, no matter how far they walk. The people are broken, their spirits crushed under centuries of Strahd's rule.</p>
                
                <p style="margin-top: 1rem;">A fortune-teller named <strong>Madam Eva</strong> reveals your destiny through her tarokka cards, you are meant to face the ancient evil that haunts this land. Three artifacts of power await discovery. An ally will aid you. And a final confrontation with the vampire lord himself looms.</p>
                
                <p style="margin-top: 1rem;"><strong>But be warned:</strong> Strahd is not a villain to be easily defeated. He is a master tactician, a powerful wizard, and has had centuries to perfect his cruelty. He will test you, torment you, and try to break your spirit before he kills you.</p>
                
                <p style="margin-top: 1rem; font-style: italic; color: #fca5a5;">Can you bring light to this land of darkness? Can you break the curse and free Barovia? Or will you become just another ghost wandering the Old Svalich Road, another failed challenger in Strahd's endless game?</p>

                <h2>Campaign Overview</h2>
                
                <h3>The Land of Barovia</h3>
                <p>Barovia exists in a demiplane, torn from its original world by the mysterious <strong>Dark Powers</strong>. Deadly mists surround the land, no matter how far you walk, you end up back where you started. The sun never fully breaks through the perpetual cloud cover, casting everything in gray gloom.</p>
                
                <p style="margin-top: 0.75rem;">This land is trapped in time, isolated from the outside world. The same souls are reborn generation after generation. The people are broken, terrified, and have long since abandoned hope. They cower in their villages, fearing the night and the wolves that howl from the Svalich Woods.</p>
                
                <h3>Strahd von Zarovich - The Ancient</h3>
                <p><strong>In life</strong>, Strahd von Zarovich was a count, a prince, a soldier, and a conqueror. After the death of his father, King Barov, Strahd waged long bloody wars against his family's enemies. He cornered the last of them in a remote mountain valley and slaughtered them all. He named the valley Barovia after his father.</p>
                
                <p style="margin-top: 0.75rem;">But peace made Strahd restless. He felt his best years slipping away. Unwilling to age like his father, he studied magic and forged a pact with the Dark Powers in return for immortality.</p>
                
                <p style="margin-top: 0.75rem;"><strong>Then came Tatyana.</strong> A young Barovian woman of remarkable beauty. Strahd lavished her with attention, believing her worthy to be his bride. But she fell in love with his younger brother, Sergei instead.</p>
                
                <p style="margin-top: 0.75rem;">On the day of Sergei and Tatyana's wedding, Strahd gazed into a mirror and realized he had been a fool. He murdered Sergei, drank his blood, and sealed his pact with darkness. When he chased Tatyana through the castle gardens, she threw herself from the walls rather than submit to him.</p>
                
                <p style="margin-top: 0.75rem;"><strong>Strahd became a vampire.</strong> The sky went black. The castle guards shot him with arrows, but he did not die. He slaughtered them all. The castle and valley were spirited away, locked in a demiplane surrounded by deadly mists. For Strahd and his people, there would be no escape.</p>
                
                <p style="margin-top: 0.75rem; font-style: italic; color: #fca5a5;">For centuries now, Strahd has ruled Barovia. He takes consorts, feeds on the people, and plays games with strangers who wander into his domain. Every generation, Tatyana's soul is reborn. The current incarnation is <strong>Ireena Kolyana</strong>, and Strahd will stop at nothing to claim her.</p>
                
                <h3>Strahd's Goals</h3>
                <div class="grid grid-2">
                    <div class="card">
                        <h4>Claim Ireena</h4>
                        <p style="font-size: 0.875rem;">Strahd has already bitten Ireena twice. He intends to turn her into his vampire spawn consort, believing her to be Tatyana reborn.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="card">
                        <h4>Find Van Richten</h4>
                        <p style="font-size: 0.875rem;">The legendary vampire hunter has come to Barovia in disguise. Strahd wants to find him, lock him in his dungeons, and slowly break his spirit.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="card">
                        <h4>Test the Newcomers</h4>
                        <p style="font-size: 0.875rem;">Strahd senses your arrival. He will test you, studying your tactics and weaknesses. Are you worthy challengers? Or just more prey?</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="card">
                        <h4>Find a Successor</h4>
                        <p style="font-size: 0.875rem;">Deep down, Strahd believes the key to escaping Barovia is finding someone worthy to rule in his place. But his arrogance ensures no one is ever good enough.</p>

                <h3>How to Defeat Strahd</h3>
                <p>Strahd cannot be permanently destroyed unless several conditions are met:</p>
                <ul style="font-size: 0.875rem; margin-top: 0.5rem;">
                    <li><strong>Find the Three Fated Treasures:</strong> The Sunsword, Holy Symbol of Ravenkind, and Tome of Strahd (locations determined by Tarokka reading)</li>
                    <li><strong>Destroy the Heart of Sorrow:</strong> A 10-foot crystal in Castle Ravenloft that absorbs all damage meant for Strahd</li>
                    <li><strong>Reduce Strahd to 0 HP:</strong> Force him into mist form and back to his coffin</li>
                    <li><strong>Stake him in his coffin:</strong> While at 0 HP in his coffin, drive a wooden stake through his heart</li>
                    <li><strong>Expose him to sunlight:</strong> Or keep him staked until sunrise to destroy him permanently</li>
                </ul>
                
                <p style="margin-top: 1rem; font-style: italic; color: #fca5a5;">But even if you destroy Strahd, will the mists release Barovia? Or will the Dark Powers simply choose a new master? Some questions have no easy answers.</p>

                <h3>The Mists of Barovia</h3>
                <div class="card-lg">
                    <p>Deadly fog surrounds Barovia. Any creature that tries to leave must make an <strong>Instinct roll (Difficulty 20)</strong> every hour or gain 1 level of Stress. Even flying creatures cannot escape.</p>
                    <p>The mists turn travelers around, no matter how far you walk, you end up back in Barovia.</p>
                </div>
                
                <h3>Sunlight in Barovia</h3>
                <div class="card-lg">
                    <p>By the will of the Dark Powers, the sun never fully shines. Even during the day, thick clouds or mist obscure the light.</p>
                    <p><strong>Effect:</strong> Daylight in Barovia provides bright light but does NOT count as sunlight for vampire vulnerabilities. Strahd and his spawn can move about during the day. Only magical sunlight (from spells or items like the Sunsword) affects vampires normally.</p>
                </div>
                
                <h3>Fortunes of Ravenloft</h3>
                <div class="card-lg">
                    <p>When the party first meets Madam Eva, she performs a tarokka card reading that determines the location of three powerful artifacts and where Strahd can be confronted.</p>
                    <h4>The Fated Items:</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>The Tome of Strahd: A journal revealing Strahd's history</li>
                        <li>The Sunsword: A legendary blade that deals magic damage and creates true sunlight</li>
                        <li>The Holy Symbol of Ravenkind: Can hold vampires at bay and cause direct damage</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Whenever a PC discovers one of the fated items, they immediately gain <strong>3 Hope tokens</strong> and clear <strong>1d4 Stress</strong>.</p>
                </div>
                
                <h3>Hope in Despair</h3>
                <div class="card-lg">
                    <p>Barovia is a land where hope dies slowly. This mechanic represents the difficulty of maintaining morale.</p>
                    <p><strong>Rule:</strong> At the start of each session, each PC must make a <strong>Presence roll (Difficulty 12)</strong>. On a failure, they start the session with 1 fewer Hope token (minimum 0).</p>
                    <p><strong>Exception:</strong> If the party made significant progress last session (rescued someone, found a treasure, defeated a major foe), this roll is not required.</p>

                        <p style="font-size: 0.875rem;">Rangers, druids, hermits. You live in the Svalich Woods or mountains, away from civilization. You might be part of the Keepers of the Feather (wereravens) or survive alone.</p>
                        <p style="font-size: 0.75rem; color: #9ca3af; margin-top: 0.5rem;"><em>Examples:</strong> Wereraven ally, forest hermit, mountain guide, druid</em></p>
                    </div>
                    
                    <div class="card">
                        <h4>Ridgeborne</h4>
                        <p style="font-size: 0.875rem;">Mountaineers, miners, isolated villagers. You're from Krezk or other mountain communities. Hardy, suspicious of outsiders, but protective of your own.</p>
                        <p style="font-size: 0.75rem; color: #9ca3af; margin-top: 0.5rem;"><em>Examples:</strong> Krezk villager, mountain shepherd, stone mason, miner</em></p>

                        <p style="font-size: 0.875rem;">You come from beyond Barovia, a traveler from distant shores. The mists have trapped you far from home, and you seek a way back, or forward.</p>
                        <p style="font-size: 0.75rem; color: #9ca3af; margin-top: 0.5rem;"><em>Examples:</strong> Shipwrecked sailor, foreign merchant, lost traveler, explorer</em></p>

                <h3>Character Motivations</h3>
                <p style="font-size: 0.875rem; color: #d1d5db; margin-bottom: 1rem;">Why does your character dare to oppose Strahd when all others have given up?</p>
                
                <div class="card-lg">
                    <h4>Motivation Options</h4>
                    <ul style="font-size: 0.875rem;">
                        <li><strong>Protect Someone:</strong> Ireena, a family member, or innocents. You won't let Strahd take them.</li>
                        <li><strong>Seek Revenge:</strong> Strahd killed someone you loved. You'll destroy him or die trying.</li>
                        <li><strong>Break the Curse:</strong> You believe you're meant to end this. Prophecy, duty, or stubborn hope drives you.</li>
                        <li><strong>Escape:</strong> You want out of Barovia and will do anything, even face Strahd, to leave.</li>
                        <li><strong>Redemption:</strong> You failed someone before. This is your chance to make it right.</li>
                        <li><strong>Power:</strong> You seek the secrets of the Amber Temple or artifacts to gain strength.</li>
                        <li><strong>Faith:</strong> The Morninglord, the Dark Powers, or another force has called you here.</li>
                        <li><strong>Curiosity:</strong> You're a scholar, monster hunter, or explorer drawn to the mystery.</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>

                <h3>Barovia-Specific Backgrounds</h3>
                <div class="grid grid-2">
                    <div class="card">
                        <h4>Haunted One</h4>
                        <p style="font-size: 0.875rem;">You've witnessed something that shattered your understanding of reality. You came to Barovia seeking answers or running from your past. You're harder to frighten but haunted by visions.</p>
                    </div>
                    
                    <div class="card">
                        <h4>Vampire Hunter</h4>
                        <p style="font-size: 0.875rem;">You've trained specifically to hunt undead. You know their weaknesses, carry holy water and wooden stakes, and understand what you're facing, which makes it worse.</p>
                    </div>
                    
                    <div class="card">
                        <h4>Cursed Lineage</h4>
                        <p style="font-size: 0.875rem;">You're related to someone important in Barovia's history, perhaps Tatyana, the Order of the Silver Dragon, or even Strahd himself. This connection draws you here.</p>
                    </div>
                    
                    <div class="card">
                        <h4>Lost Noble</h4>
                        <p style="font-size: 0.875rem;">You were nobility elsewhere, but now you're trapped here. Your title means nothing, but your education and bearing might earn respect, or resentment.</p>
                    </div>
                </div>

                <h3>Party Bonds</h3>
                <p style="font-size: 0.875rem; color: #d1d5db; margin-bottom: 1rem;">In Barovia, trust is survival. Establish connections between PCs at Session Zero.</p>
                
                <div class="card-lg">
                    <h4>Bond Examples</h4>
                    <ol style="font-size: 0.875rem;">
                        <li>We traveled together and entered the mists as a group</li>
                        <li>We're family, siblings, cousins, or found family</li>
                        <li>One of us saved the other's life before entering Barovia</li>
                        <li>We share a common enemy or goal that led us here</li>
                        <li>We met in the Village of Barovia and realized we're stronger together</li>
                        <li>One of us received Kolyan's letter and recruited the others to help</li>
                        <li>We're bound by oath, pact, or shared prophecy</li>
                        <li>We survived Death House together, that bonds people for life</li>
                    </ol>
                </div>

                <h3>Starting Equipment Considerations</h3>
                <div class="card-lg">
                    <p style="font-size: 0.875rem;"><strong>Recommended Items for Barovia:</strong></p>
                    <ul style="font-size: 0.875rem;">
                        <li><strong>Torches/Lanterns:</strong> Darkness is everywhere and dangerous</li>
                        <li><strong>Holy Symbols:</strong> Even if not religious, they help against undead</li>
                        <li><strong>Wooden Stakes:</strong> Essential vampire-hunting gear</li>
                        <li><strong>Silvered Weapons:</strong> For lycanthropes (expensive but vital)</li>
                        <li><strong>Rope:</strong> Escape, rescue, climbing ancient ruins</li>
                        <li><strong>Rations:</strong> Food is scarce and often tainted</li>
                        <li><strong>Holy Water:</strong> Precious and powerful against undead</li>
                        <li><strong>Mirror:</strong> Vampires cast no reflection, useful for identification</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>

                <h3>Class Recommendations</h3>
                <p style="font-size: 0.875rem; color: #d1d5db; margin-bottom: 1rem;">All classes work in Barovia, but some themes resonate particularly well with the gothic horror setting.</p>
                
                <div class="grid grid-2">
                    <div class="card">
                        <h4>Guardian / Warrior</h4>
                        <p style="font-size: 0.875rem;">Protectors of the innocent, knights seeking to restore honor, or simple defenders standing against the darkness. Your courage matters more than your sword.</p>
                    </div>
                    
                    <div class="card">
                        <h4>Ranger / Rogue</h4>
                        <p style="font-size: 0.875rem;">Survivors who know the land, trackers hunting monsters, or infiltrators seeking Strahd's weaknesses. Knowledge and cunning are weapons here.</p>
                    </div>
                    
                    <div class="card">
                        <h4>Wizard / Sorcerer</h4>
                        <p style="font-size: 0.875rem;">Seekers of arcane knowledge, challengers to Strahd's magical dominance, or desperate souls willing to risk dark power at the Amber Temple.</p>
                    </div>
                    
                    <div class="card">
                        <h4>Cleric / Druid</h4>
                        <p style="font-size: 0.875rem;">Faithful servants of the Morninglord or nature itself, bringing light and healing to a land that desperately needs both. Your magic is hope incarnate.</p>
